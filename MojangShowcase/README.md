## Mojang Showcase Documentation

In the video, we see the date the world was last joined. However, the generated seed for a new world uses the epoch time at the time of creation, not last joined. But we do know when the stream happened; January 28, 2013. This means that if the world was generated on that day, between the beginning of the day, and the time of last join, there are a possible 57,300 seeds (number of seconds between) but it is likely the world was generated closer to the last join time, so work back from there.

### Summary:

 - FunWorld world last quit: 3:55 PM CET  
 - Unnamed world last quit: 4:05 PM CET  
 - Stream Started: 4:32 PM CET
